# Introduction


Author: <Authors names="ciaochaos" />, 2024-03-02


Highly inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [airbnb/visx](https://airbnb.io/visx/), [Squarespace](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/4424780922509-Section-background-art), [Apple Keynote](https://support.apple.com/guide/keynote/change-a-slide-background-tan52c1cf827/mac), I created UVCanvas - a React component library that provides a rich set of dynamic canvases out of the box. These canvases are perfect for web backgrounds, wallpapers, and design materials.

I hope this library can have the following features:

- Zero configuration
- High performance
- Better tree shaking
- Well documented
- Embrace open source

This project is in its infancy and any kind of contribution is welcome!
